goal: Implemented Bridge app redesign with native iOS tabs, system colors, and unified Docker view
now: Test app in Expo Go, verify all tabs work, check usage cards display
test: npx expo start --ios  # verify app loads and tabs function

done_this_session:
  - task: Created native theme system with PlatformColor
    files: [lib/colors.ts, lib/theme.ts]
  - task: Converted to NativeTabs with 4 tabs (Sessions, Hosts, Docker, More)
    files: [app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx, app/(tabs)/index.tsx, app/(tabs)/hosts.tsx, app/(tabs)/docker.tsx, app/(tabs)/more.tsx]
  - task: Built unified Docker view with host filtering
    files: [lib/docker-hooks.ts, app/(tabs)/docker.tsx]
  - task: Created SessionCard and HostCard components
    files: [components/SessionCard.tsx, components/HostCard.tsx]
  - task: Added usage cards for Claude/Codex with progress bars
    files: [app/(tabs)/index.tsx]
  - task: Moved LaunchSheet to root layout for proper z-index
    files: [lib/launch-sheet.tsx, app/_layout.tsx]
  - task: Polished all pages with native iOS style
    files: [app/hosts/[id]/index.tsx, app/ports/index.tsx, app/projects/index.tsx, app/keybinds.tsx]
  - task: Removed unused routes (hosts/index.tsx, hosts/[id]/docker.tsx)

blockers: []

questions:
  - Does liquid glass render correctly on iOS 26+ simulator?

decisions:
  - launch_button_location: Header next to title (FAB removed, NativeTabs doesn't support accessories)
  - usage_bar_direction: Shows percent remaining (not percent used)
  - docker_route_consolidation: Removed per-host docker list, unified tab handles all with filtering

findings:
  - nativetabs_role_limited: NativeTabs roles are predefined iOS system items only (search, history, etc.)
  - launch_sheet_zindex: Moving to root layout fixes z-index above native tab bar
  - date_format_api: Reset times come as ISO timestamps, need parsing to relative time

worked:
  - Agent orchestration for 10-task implementation (context-efficient)
  - Global context for LaunchSheet state
  - hostId query param for Docker tab filtering

failed:
  - Tried NativeTabs accessory button (not supported)

next:
  - Test in Expo Go on iOS device/simulator
  - Verify usage cards show real data from agent
  - Add animations/polish if needed
  - Consider adding long-press on sessions to open detail page
