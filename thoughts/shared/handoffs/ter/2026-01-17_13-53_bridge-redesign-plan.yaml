goal: Plan Bridge app redesign - native iOS feel with NativeTabs, system colors, fewer taps to Docker
now: Start implementing Task 1 (native theme with PlatformColor) and Task 2 (NativeTabs structure)
test: npx expo start --ios  # verify app loads in Expo Go

done_this_session:
  - task: Explored current codebase structure and navigation
    files: [app/index.tsx, app/hosts/[id]/index.tsx, app/hosts/[id]/docker.tsx]
  - task: Designed new navigation (4 tabs - Sessions, Hosts, Docker, More)
    files: [thoughts/shared/plans/PLAN-bridge-redesign.md]
  - task: Chose visual identity - native iOS with system colors
    files: [thoughts/shared/plans/PLAN-bridge-redesign.md]
  - task: Verified Expo Go compatibility for NativeTabs and components
    files: []

blockers: []

questions:
  - Android drawable alternatives for SF Symbols in NativeTabs?

decisions:
  - app_name: Bridge (command center / starship bridge vibes)
  - visual_style: Native iOS system-adaptive (not custom dark/neon)
  - tab_bar: NativeTabs with liquid glass (works in Expo Go)
  - colors: PlatformColor for system colors (auto light/dark)
  - lists: gesture-handler Swipeable (Expo Go compatible, not @expo/ui)
  - context_menus: Alert.alert fallback (native menus need dev build)

findings:
  - nativetabs_expo_go: NativeTabs works in Expo Go (confirmed via GitHub issues)
  - expo_ui_needs_devbuild: "@expo/ui SwiftUI components require development build"
  - current_docker_taps: Docker requires 2-3 taps currently, goal is 1 tap

worked:
  - WebSearch for verifying Expo Go compatibility
  - Reading GitHub issues to confirm NativeTabs works in Expo Go

failed:
  - Initially assumed @expo/ui worked in Expo Go (it doesn't)

next:
  - Create lib/colors.ts with PlatformColor mappings
  - Create app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx with NativeTabs
  - Create app/(tabs)/index.tsx (Sessions)
  - Create app/(tabs)/hosts.tsx
  - Create app/(tabs)/docker.tsx (unified view)
  - Create app/(tabs)/more.tsx
  - Update components to use system colors
