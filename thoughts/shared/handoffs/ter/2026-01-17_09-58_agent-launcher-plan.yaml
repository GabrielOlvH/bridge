goal: Plan agent launcher feature - launch any command from home screen bottom sheet
now: Review plan at thoughts/shared/plans/PLAN-agent-launcher.md and approve for implementation

test: pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint

done_this_session:
  - task: Explored codebase structure and patterns
    files: [lib/types.ts, lib/store.tsx, lib/api.ts, app/index.tsx]
  - task: Interviewed user for UX requirements
    files: []
  - task: Created implementation plan with 12 tasks
    files: [thoughts/shared/plans/PLAN-agent-launcher.md]
  - task: Created plan handoff document
    files: [thoughts/shared/handoffs/ter/2026-01-17_plan-agent-launcher.md]

blockers: []

questions:
  - Where exactly is the agent backend code? (packages/agent/src/index.ts or elsewhere)
  - Is @gorhom/bottom-sheet compatible with current Expo/RN version?

decisions:
  - bottom_sheet_ux: User preferred bottom sheet over wizard or dedicated tab
  - per_host_projects: Each host has own project list (not global with overrides)
  - on_demand_scripts: Fetch package.json when project selected (not cached)
  - in_app_commands: Custom commands added via app form, not project config file
  - auto_session_names: Generate names like projectName-timestamp (no prompt)
  - any_command: Not limited to agent CLIs - any command string works

findings:
  - existing_pattern: App uses Context + AsyncStorage for state (hosts, keybinds)
  - terminal_works: WebView + xterm.js attachment already implemented
  - session_api: POST /sessions to host agent creates tmux sessions

worked:
  - Scout agent for codebase exploration
  - Iterative AskUserQuestion for UX requirements gathering

failed: []

next:
  - User reviews plan at thoughts/shared/plans/PLAN-agent-launcher.md
  - Run /implement_plan to start implementation
  - Begin with Tasks 1-5 (foundation) before UI tasks
