# Implementation Report: Native Tabs with Liquid Glass
Generated: 2026-01-17

## Task
Enhance the tabs layout with proper NativeTabs configuration for liquid glass on iOS 26+.

## TDD Summary

### Tests Written
This task did not require new tests as it is a UI enhancement using existing expo-router APIs with existing store/live hooks.

### Implementation
- `/home/gabrielolv/Documents/Projects/ter/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Updated with:
  - tintColor for active tab styling
  - minimizeBehavior for iOS 26 liquid glass
  - Badge components for session/container counts
  - Integration with useStore and useHostsLive hooks

## Test Results
- Build verification: PASSED (expo export --platform ios)
- Bundle: 3417 modules compiled in 54275ms

## Changes Made

1. Added import for `useMemo` from React
2. Added import for `Badge` from expo-router/unstable-native-tabs
3. Added imports for `useStore` and `useHostsLive` from lib
4. Added `tintColor="#00d9ff"` to NativeTabs
5. Added `minimizeBehavior="onScrollDown"` for iOS 26+
6. Added sessionCount memo to calculate total sessions across hosts
7. Added runningContainers memo to calculate total running containers
8. Added Badge to Sessions tab showing sessionCount (hidden when 0)
9. Added Badge to Docker tab showing runningContainers (hidden when 0)

## Files Modified

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `/home/gabrielolv/Documents/Projects/ter/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` | Updated |

## API Usage

### NativeTabs Props Used
- `tintColor: ColorValue` - Sets the tint color for active tab icons/labels
- `minimizeBehavior: 'automatic' | 'never' | 'onScrollDown' | 'onScrollUp'` - Controls tab bar minimize behavior on iOS 26+

### Badge Props Used
- `children: string` - Badge text content
- `hidden: boolean` - Whether to hide the badge

## Notes

- The Badge component from expo-router/unstable-native-tabs requires string children
- minimizeBehavior only works on iOS 26+, is ignored on earlier versions
- The hooks (useStore, useHostsLive) establish WebSocket connections for real-time data
