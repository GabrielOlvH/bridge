# Implementation Report: Redesign Host Cards
Generated: 2026-01-17

## Task
Create a new HostCard component with inline quick actions for the Bridge app redesign.

## Summary
Successfully redesigned the HostCard component with the following features:
- GlassCard base with host color indicator
- Status badge with appropriate colors (online=green, offline=red, checking=orange)
- Stats display: session count, container count, CPU/RAM metrics
- Inline [Terminal] and [Docker] action buttons
- Card tap navigation to host detail
- Disabled state for offline hosts

## Implementation

### New HostCard Props
```typescript
type HostCardProps = {
  host: Host;
  status: 'online' | 'offline' | 'checking';
  sessionCount: number;
  containerCount?: number;
  metrics?: { cpu?: number; ram?: number };
  onPress: () => void;
  onTerminal: () => void;
  onDocker: () => void;
};
```

### Files Changed
1. `/home/gabrielolv/Documents/Projects/ter/components/HostCard.tsx`
   - Complete redesign with new props interface
   - Three-section layout: header, stats, actions
   - Status colors using palette (mint/blush/surfaceAlt backgrounds)
   - Terminal and Docker action buttons with icons

2. `/home/gabrielolv/Documents/Projects/ter/app/(tabs)/hosts.tsx`
   - Refactored to use new HostCard component
   - Added docker data fetching
   - Added containerCounts memo
   - Added handleTerminal/handleDocker callbacks

3. `/home/gabrielolv/Documents/Projects/ter/app/hosts/index.tsx`
   - Updated to use new HostCard API
   - Added session/container counts
   - Added action handlers

## Test Results
- TypeScript check: PASSED (npx tsc --noEmit)
- No runtime tests available for UI components

## Design Decisions
1. Used Box icon from lucide-react-native for Docker (Container icon doesn't exist)
2. Used palette colors instead of systemColors for status badges (PlatformColor doesn't support string concatenation for opacity)
3. Created local CardStatus type to handle 'unknown' status from HostStatus type

## Handoff
Created: `/home/gabrielolv/Documents/Projects/ter/thoughts/handoffs/bridge-redesign/task-05-host-card.md`
